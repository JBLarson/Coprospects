                        <p>For small and medium businesses, every marketing dollar counts. You invest in PPC campaigns on Google, Facebook, and Instagram to drive traffic, but if your website or landing page isn't optimized to convert that traffic, you're losing potential revenue and diminishing your ad ROI. A suboptimal website—slow, confusing, not mobile-friendly, or poorly optimized for SEO—directly impacts your Google Ads Quality Score, inflates click costs, and frustrates potential customers.</p>
